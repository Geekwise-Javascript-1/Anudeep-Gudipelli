/*
The first two should store the numbers:
values 12
and 30
(for an extra challenge... convert 30 into a hexadecimal)
The third variable should store the string "Answer equals: "
Add the first two numeric variables together using the + operator, save this to a new variable.
Concatenate the string from your third variable with the number from your fourth (new) variable. Save this to a new variable called "answer".
Console log answer.*/

var x = 12;
var y = 30;
var a = "Answer Equals:";
var z = x + y;
var answer = a + z;
console.log(answer)
